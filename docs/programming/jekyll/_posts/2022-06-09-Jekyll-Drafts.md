## Jekyll drafts for _posts

Hello!

As I continue to learn and build this website I have found a new feature for Jekyll Posts called Drafts.

The following command will check for drafted posts in the _drafts/ directory:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --draft`

These posts in the drafts folder will not be built into the normal site until moved to _posts.

You can checkout the docs here: [Jekyll Docs Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

More to come!
