# About Me

Hi, I’m Beau—a systems thinker and creative technologist passionate about modular design, visual clarity, and user empowerment.

## What I Build

- 🧠 Modular AI agents with swappable decision modules and visual feedback
- 🎮 Vision-based automation for classic games like Pokémon Red
- 🎨 Earth-tone UI systems that feel natural, resilient, and human-centered
- 🛠️ Persistent settings modules for voice, theme, and user control

## My Philosophy

I believe technology should be transparent, adaptable, and poetic. Every scaffold, overlay, and debugger I build is an expression of that ethos.

## Current Projects

- Redesigning my Jekyll site with category/tag indexes and modular navigation
- Scaffolding a visual debugger for emulator-based agents
- Building a persistent voice settings module with waveform feedback
