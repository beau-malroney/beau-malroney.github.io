## ðŸ›  Add VS Code `code` Command to macOS Terminal

If you're trying to run `code` in the terminal and see:

```bash
zsh: command not found: code
```

It means the VS Code command line tool isnâ€™t in your PATH.

#### 1. Open VS Code

#### 2. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette

#### 3. Type and select:

```
Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH
```

Youâ€™ll see a message like:
> Shell command 'code' successfully installed in PATH.

#### 4. Run 
```
exec zsh
```

### ðŸ§ª Test it

```bash
code .
```

This should open the current folder in VS Code.

You can also open a specific file using

```
code ./path-to-file
```
