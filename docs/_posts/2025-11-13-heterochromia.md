## Today I Learned: Central Heterochromia

Have you ever noticed someone’s eyes have a second ring of color right around their pupil? Today I learned this is called **central heterochromia**—a striking and rare eye color pattern!

### What is Central Heterochromia?
Central heterochromia is an eye condition in which the iris features two concentric rings of different colors. The area close to the pupil (the central ring) appears as a distinct color—like gold, hazel, or amber—while the rest of the iris shows another color, such as blue or green. This unique pattern is different from sectoral heterochromia (which causes wedge-shaped patches of color) or complete heterochromia (where each eye is a different color).

### How Common Is It?
Less than 1% of people have central heterochromia. It tends to be more visible in people with lighter eyes because the contrast is easier to spot. Most cases are genetic and completely harmless, although it can rarely relate to other eye conditions.

### Does It Affect Vision?
No—central heterochromia is generally just a cosmetic trait and does not impact eyesight or eye health.

### How Is It Different from Other Heterochromia?
- **Central heterochromia:** A second ring of color around the pupil
- **Sectoral heterochromia:** A patch or wedge of different color in the iris
- **Complete heterochromia:** Each eye is a totally different color

### In Summary
**Central heterochromia** is when your iris has a second ring of color around the pupil. It's rare, completely safe, and produces a truly stunning effect—making your eyes memorable to everyone who notices!
