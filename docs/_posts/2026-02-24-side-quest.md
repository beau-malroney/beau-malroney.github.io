  The Oklahoma Aquarium in Jenks continues to feature its core family‑friendly exhibits like Sharks, Polynesian Reef, and interactive touch tanks, with daily keeper chats and feedings noted on their calendar as ongoing offerings rather than one‑off events. This matters if you’re planning a spontaneous local “aquarium day” with the kids and want something fun that isn’t tied to a specific date or festival.  

- **Jenks Chamber Community Events – Spring Lineup Forming**  
  *Source: Jenks Chamber of Commerce events page, updated January 25, 2026*  
  The Jenks Chamber’s community events calendar has been refreshed for 2026, with recurring luncheons and annual festivals like the Chamber Gala and seasonal downtown gatherings listed as upcoming, though many still have “save the date” style placeholders rather than detailed agendas. This is a good page to bookmark now so you can grab tickets or plan Main Street outings as soon as the spring and summer family events (like food trucks and holiday‑themed nights) get firm dates.  

- **SPLASH! 2026 Benefit Event (Jenks/Area)**

  The Chamber’s description of Main Street Jenks festivals (like holiday markets, carriage rides, and “winter wonderland”‑style evenings) has been refreshed for the 2026 season, signaling that similar experiences will return later this year even if exact dates are still pending. Fans of cozy small‑town street festivals should keep an eye on that page to lock in dates as fall and winter plans are finalized.

  *Source: ConcertFix Oklahoma City 2026 calendar*  
  The Oklahoma City concert calendar lists shows on March 1, 2026, including Cory Branan, Vitamin String Quartet at Tower Theatre, and Donny Benet at Beer City Music Hall, with tickets still available across all three. If you’re up for a short road trip, this is an easy way to stack a weekend getaway with live music in smaller, fan‑friendly venues.  

- **Statewide 2026 Schedules Filling In**  
  *Source: ConcertFix Oklahoma City 2026 calendar*  
  Regional 2026 calendars for Oklahoma are starting to populate with more spring shows, even if some Tulsa and Jenks venues haven’t pushed full summer lineups yet.

  Updates for 2026 show notable price increases on some Disney World vacation packages and tickets (up roughly 5–15% depending on date and market) alongside a refurbishment calendar that temporarily closes fan‑favorite attractions while new experiences roll in. This affects a huge swath of families planning 2026 vacations, since it impacts both budgets and which rides will be open on travel dates.  

- **RuneScape 3’s Monetization Overhaul (Treasure Hunter Removal)**  
  *Source: RuneScape 3 “Road to Restoration” article, January 19, 2026*

  *Source: Disney World refurbishment calendar, February 3, 2026*  
  Both the Beauty and the Beast Sing‑Along and Impressions de France in EPCOT’s France Pavilion are scheduled to go down for refurbishment starting February 22, 2026, leaving that corner of the park temporarily light on indoor show options. It’s an odd double‑hit that could shift crowd patterns and make nearby attractions and dining more crowded during that window.  

## 7. Disney Theme Park News (Overall)

- **Cinderella Castle Refurbishment, 2026**  
  *Source: Disney parks 2026 changes article*  
  A major 2026 refurbishment is planned for Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World, with work affecting daytime views and potentially shifting show and fireworks logistics on select dates.

- **Annual Pass & Pricing Adjustments for 2026**  
  *Source: Disney parks 2026 changes article; Disney World pricing analysis*  
  Reports highlight updated annual pass structures and higher price points rolling out across both U.S. Disney resorts in 2026, with some tiers reshuffled and overall costs trending upward. Frequent visitors and locals especially will feel this, as it may change which pass tier makes sense or whether a pass remains better value than trip‑by‑trip tickets.  

- **Show & Entertainment Shuffles Across Both Coasts**  
  *Source: Disney parks 2026 changes article*  
  The 2026 changes include rotation and updating of parades, nighttime spectaculars, and stage shows as part of multi‑year refresh efforts.

  Beauty and the Beast Sing‑Along and Impressions de France are scheduled to close for refurbishment starting February 22, 2026, leaving fewer film‑style attractions in the pavilion for a while. EPCOT fans who love these as low‑key, air‑conditioned breaks will want to adjust their touring plans and expectations.  

- **Frozen Ever After – Temporary Closure (February 2026)**  
  *Source: Disney World refurbishment calendar, February 3, 2026*  
  Frozen Ever After is listed as closed for refurbishment through “sometime in February 2026,” suggesting a limited‑time downtime before returning later in the month. This impacts families with Frozen‑obsessed kids, so if this ride is non‑negotiable, it’s worth aiming for late‑February or later dates.  

- **Soarin’ Around the World -> Soarin’ Across America (By Memorial Day 2026)**  
  *Source: Disney World refurbishment calendar, February 3, 2026*

  *Source: Disney parks 2026 changes article*  
  The report underscores that Disneyland is also engaging in targeted refurbishments of popular attractions and entertainment offerings in 2026, timed alongside updates in Florida.

  *Source: CruiseMapper DCL 2026 deployment article, February 12, 2025*

For current players, this is essentially a soft reboot year that promises to modernize systems without abandoning the core identity of the game.  

- **Combat Modernization Update Landing February 2026**  
  *Source: RuneScape 3 roadmap article, January 19, 2026*

- **Havenhythe Expansion – Largest Area Ever (Spring & Late 2026)**  
  *Source: RuneScape 3 roadmap article, January 19, 2026*  
  Havenhythe, described as RuneScape’s largest area to date, will roll out in two parts, with Part 1 in spring 2026 and Part 2 at year’s end, bringing new quests, bosses, and progression.

- **Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts Teased**  
  *Source: OSRS Winter Summit 2026 overview via YouTube breakdown, January 25, 2026*  
  Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts is positioned as the next big temporary league, layering on powerful pact mechanics that also introduce new risks and challenges. League players are already theory‑crafting broken combos and starter paths, so it’s a good time to prepare accounts and clear schedules.  

- **Raids 4: The Fractured Archive in Development**  
  *Source: OSRS Winter Summit 2026 overview via YouTube breakdown, January 25, 2026*  
  Raids 4: The Fractured Archive was officially unveiled as part of the 2026 roadmap, promising a new endgame group PvM challenge. This will likely redefine best‑in‑slot gear chases and clan activity schedules, so raiders should expect a new long‑term goal to emerge once more details are shared.

  *Source: OSRS Winter Summit 2026 overview via YouTube breakdown, January 25, 2026*
