Frozen Ever After at EPCOT closed in late January 2026 for a refurbishment that upgrades the ride’s audio‑animatronic figures to match the advanced technology used at Hong Kong Disneyland’s World of Frozen.[web:6] This matters because Frozen fans visiting right now will miss the ride temporarily, but can look forward to a more “true‑to‑film” experience when it reopens, expected in February 2026.[web:6]
