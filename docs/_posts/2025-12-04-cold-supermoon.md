Tonight, December 4, 2025, marks the Cold Moon—the year's final full moon and third supermoon—reaching peak illumination at 5:14 p.m. CST (23:14 UTC). This event occurs as the moon sits just 221,806 miles from Earth at perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than average full moons.

## Peak Timing and Visibility

The moon hits full phase during late afternoon CST, appearing fully illuminated from December 3 evening through December 5. In CST locations, expect moonrise around 4:00-5:00 p.m. near sunset, climbing high overhead by midnight—its highest path of 2025 due to the approaching winter solstice on December 21. Clear winter skies enhance visibility even in light-polluted areas, with the moon in Gemini constellation.

## Why It's Special: Supermoon and Height

As a supermoon, the moon's elliptical orbit brings it within 90% of perigee during full phase, amplifying size and glow compared to micromoons at apogee. This Cold Moon stands out further: opposite the low solstice sun, it reaches maximum elevation in the Northern Hemisphere, a rare peak tied to the 18.6-year lunar standstill cycle not repeating until 2042. No major occultations occur, but its perigee timing just 12 hours before full phase boosts brilliance.

## Observation Tips

Catch the dramatic "moon illusion" at moonrise from an elevated spot with eastern horizon views—use apps like TimeAndDate for exact local times. Binoculars reveal craters sharply; avoid high telescope power to prevent shake from atmospheric turbulence. Dress warmly, as December chill defines the name from Northern Hemisphere traditions.
