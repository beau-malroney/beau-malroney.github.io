## What Libby is

Libby is a modern reading app by OverDrive that connects to your public libraries. With a valid library card, you can borrow digital books and magazines, read or listen on your phone or tablet, and return them automatically—no late fees.

- Cost: Free to use with your library card.
- Formats: Ebooks, audiobooks, and magazines.
- Devices: iOS, Android, and web reader; Kindle transfer is supported in the U.S. for many titles.


> Each library curates its own digital collection, so selection and wait times vary. Adding multiple libraries expands your options.

## Why I love it

- Zero friction: Borrow in seconds; returns happen automatically.
- Queue sanity: Holds, estimates, and “deliver later” keep your reading flow steady without overwhelm.
- Thoughtful features: Tags, filters, and dark/sepia modes make it easy to organize and actually finish books.
- Family-friendly: Profiles aren’t a feature, but tags and smart filters can mimic them for shared devices.

## How to get started

1. Install Libby: Grab the app on your device and open it.
2. Find your library: Search by city or zip, then add it.
3. Add your card: Enter your library card number/PIN. Repeat for more libraries if you have them.
4. Search and sample: Tap a title to see availability; read a sample or borrow if it’s in.
5. Borrow or place a hold: If it’s checked out, place a hold to join the queue.
6. Read or listen: Use the built-in reader/player or download for offline.


> Tip: Turn on notifications in Libby so you never miss a hold becoming available.

## Power tips that actually matter

- Multiple libraries, one search: Add all your cards. Libby shows availability and wait times across them so you can borrow from the fastest source.
- Tags = your secret system: Create tags like “Next". Tags are collections that live in your Shelf and can be filtered.
- Deliver later: When a hold hits at a bad time, choose “Deliver Later” to keep your place in line.
- Skip the line with lucky day titles: Some libraries mark instantly available copies that don’t allow holds—great for hot titles.
- Audiobook speed fine-tuning: Dial in custom speeds for comprehension without fatigue.
- Magazine “Notify Me” tags: Get alerts for new issues of your favorite magazines.
- Theme and typography: Switch to dark or sepia; adjust fonts, spacing, and margins to reduce eye strain.

## Copy my setup

- Libraries: Add your local state-wide and any other digital libraries you qualify for.
- Tags: “Urgent” “To Read” “Audiobook” “Kiddos” "Beach"
- Rhythm: Browse holds, borrow, “deliver later” if a stack grows beyond two.

## Wrap-up

Libby turns your library card into a bottomless, low-friction reading habit. Set up once, tag intentionally, and keep reading from your queue.
