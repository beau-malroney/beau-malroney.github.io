In the afterward of Christopher Paolini's *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars* he mentions Easter eggs in reference to *The Inheritance Cycle. This got me interested in the possibilities of crossovers and multiversal resonance. Here's a breakdown of some of the connections I found when digging in.

---

## 1. Angela and Solembum Appear

The clearest and most direct Easter egg is a mysterious woman Kira meets who’s knitting beside a large, knowing cat. This is unmistakably **Angela the herbalist** and **Solembum**, the werecat, from *The Inheritance Cycle*. Paolini himself has confirmed this is a deliberate cameo. 

Angela even gives similarly cryptic advice, and she calls herself **Inarë**—a name also tied to her character’s mysterious origins in *The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm*.

## 2. The Name "Inari"

Kira’s younger sister, who died before the events of the novel, is named **Inari**. This is the same name as a character in the story "The Worm of Kulkaras" from *The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm*. While there’s no canonical link between the two, the reuse of such a unique name is a gentle nod to attentive readers.

---

## 3. Fractals and Ancient Patterns

In *The Inheritance Cycle*, the ruin **Nal Gorgoth** featured strange fractal patterns. These visuals are echoed throughout *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars*, particularly in alien architecture and technological design. Paolini seems to have carried over his fascination with fractals into his sci-fi worldbuilding.

## 4. Pitcher Plants

In *Eragon*, pitcher plants were noted in the tunnels beneath **Gil’ead**. In *To Sleep*, the Wallfish's captain, Falconi, is particularly fond of pitcher plants, keeping them aboard the ship.

---

## 5. Right Angles and Dimensional Geometry

Angela once spoke of the unnatural "straightness of right angles" in *The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm*. In *To Sleep*, faster-than-light travel is described using right-angle geometries—a clever physics metaphor that seems thematically tied to Angela’s previous musing.

---

## 6. The Number Seven

In *Inheritance*, Brom whispers seven mysterious words to Eragon, the meaning of which is never revealed. In *To Sleep*, the afterword refers to the number seven as important, suggesting it may unlock hidden content or insights. 

---

## 7. Recurring Phrases: Sea of Stars, Dreamer, Sleeper

Phrases like **"sea of stars"**, **"dreamer"**, and **"sleeper"** appear both in *The Inheritance Cycle* and *To Sleep*.

---

## 8. Torque Gates and Interdimensional Travel

In *The Inheritance Cycle*, magical and mysterious beings sometimes hint at the existence of other dimensions or worlds. In *To Sleep*, the advanced technology known as **Torque Gates** implies the possibility of **inter-universal travel**.
