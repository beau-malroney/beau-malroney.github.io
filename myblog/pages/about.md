### **こんにちは、はじめまして!** <sub>(Hello, nice to meet you!)<sub>
I have recently spent some time on duolingo trying to learn Japanese.

Introductions! I am a software engineer who enjoys learning new technologies on the job and in my free time. I also enjoy spending time with my kid and learning new things. I strive to learn something new everyday, some of it is technology related and some is anything else that I find interesting. If I keep up with my posts here I hope I can share some of my interests and learnings with others while learning more about Jekyll and Github Pages.
